Help young kids train the Finnish alphabet. Push a button on the keyboard, and the web browser says something like "o is for orange" (in Finnish, that is).

Uses the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API). Works at least with recent versions of Chrome and Opera.
